Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
📚 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on patient medical features using machine learning.
It uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and applies a Logistic Regression model to achieve high accuracy in early detection, helping to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosis.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📂 Dataset
Source: sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()

Features: 30 numerical features based on digitized images of a breast mass.

Target classes:

0: Malignant

1: Benign

🔍 Problem Statement
Accurate early detection of breast cancer is critical to patient survival. Traditional methods can be time-consuming and subjective.
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can quickly and accurately classify tumors as malignant or benign based on clinical features.
